# Low-Cost-Weather-Station

## Description

This is a development of a low cost weather station. Low cost is realated to power consumption and price. The components used in this project are relatively cheap for regular customers costing around 5-6 dollars the total price. In terms of power consumption, the code has been developed to consume the minumum energy as possible using deepsleep mode provided for ESP8266.

## List of Components

- ESP8266 NODEMCU
- RTC DS3231
- SD CARD MODULE
- HTU21D SENSOR
- 3 10K OHMS RESISTORS
- 1 0.5UF CAPACITOR
